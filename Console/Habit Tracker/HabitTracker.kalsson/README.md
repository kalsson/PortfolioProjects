# Habit Tracker

## About The Project
Habit Tracker is a console application that enables you to keep track of your daily habits. This application lets you:

- ***Create new habits***
- ***Read existing habits***
- ***Update habit details***
- ***Delete habits***

**Note**: The application is designed to track habits based on quantity (e.g., number of water glasses a day) rather than time (e.g., hours of sleep).

## Usage
After running the application, you'll see a main menu with options for CRUD operations on habits. Follow the prompts to perform the desired actions.
